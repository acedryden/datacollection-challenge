Module 11 Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to use web-scraping tools Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to aquire data and then using Pandas and Python to analyze and visualize it. 
1. "part_1"mars_news": 
    a. There is code to use automated browsing to visit a Mars news site, and extract text elements from the website. 
    b. It then extracts titles and preview texts of the news articles, and stores them in a Python list through dictionaries and prints the results. 
2. "parts_2_mars_weather":
    a. Uses automated browsing to scrape the data in the HTML table and store the data into a Pandas DataFrame. 
    b. Examine and convert the data types in each column to appropriate data types for further analysis. 
    c. Analyze the dataset using Pandas functions and chart visualizations to answer questions on the relationship between Martian and Terrestian days, when the coldest and warmest months on Mars are, and when the highest and lowest atmospheric presure is on Mars. 
    d. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
